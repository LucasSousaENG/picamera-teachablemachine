# picamera-teachablemachine
This code allows you to use the raspberry PI camera to run a teachable machine/tensorflow generated AI.
For usage, first change the directory of the keras.h5 file to the trained file on your computer. Then just change
the response in the end the way you want (remember that it's percentage based).

Use the latest tensorflow version for it to work.
